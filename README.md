# Razer-Skibidies

**The brainrot detector that‚Äôs *actually* real (kinda).**

Inspired by the classic Razer April Fools joke about headphones that detect brainrot, this project takes it seriously... but not really.

## What even is this?

Razer once joked about a brainrot-detecting headphone set that never happened. We made this real version instead ‚Äî it analyzes audio to ‚Äúdetect brainrot‚Äù with:

- **Single Analysis:** Quick check on short clips  
- **Long-Time Analysis:** Watch brainrot evolve over longer audio
- **Visualizer:** See your audio analyzed live, because why not get a longer analysis while on a discord call or something

Try it out at [spola.hackclub.app](https://spola.hackclub.app) ‚Äî hosted on Hack Club‚Äôs Nest service (a chill Linux/tilde-inspired hosting environment).

3. Upload or record your audio  
4. Watch the visualizer do its thing
